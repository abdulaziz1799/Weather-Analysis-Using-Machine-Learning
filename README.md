# Weather-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning

Project Description:

This project centers around time series forecasting of weather parameters, specifically focusing on temperature and humidity. Through the utilization of various machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and XGBoost, we aim to address the challenge of accurately predicting future weather conditions.

The primary objective of this study is to leverage historical weather data to enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting. Given the escalating unpredictability of weather patterns and their profound impact on agriculture, transportation, and daily human activities, this research holds significant importance.

Our key aim is to compare the performance of different machine learning models in predicting weather patterns based on historical data. The project encompasses thorough data exploration, preprocessing, and model construction phases. Additionally, an extensive analysis of the findings is included in the report, providing valuable insights into the efficacy of each model and their suitability for weather forecasting applications.
